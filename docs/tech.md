# Technologies in use

- For graphics, Vulkan is the primary API.
  - OpenGL should be supported for systems without Vulkan support, specifically OpenGL ES2.
  - By default when compiling, OpenGL should be disabled to save time compiling.
- For math, GLM to make all of our lives easier.
- For physics, things are split.
- For 2D physics, box2d.
- For 3D physics, bullet.
- For sound, soloud.
- Rendering will be handled in house.

## File formats in use

Technically, this is more of a job for an editor/SDK to handle, however, I don't care.

- For audio, we prefer the OGG VORBIS format.
- For models, we prefer the FBX format, compressed raw geometry, or glTF (.glb version).
- For sprites/textures, we prefer the PNG format.
- For shaders, they should be stored somewhere outside of the main executable, however we don't care where.
  - When using both Vulkan and OpenGL, bytecode and source shaders should be stored seperately.
- For configuration files, we prefer TOML.

For everything else, we don't care how the data gets there as long as it does.
You can pack and compress everything however you want, and as long as we can get everything when we need it, it's fine.
